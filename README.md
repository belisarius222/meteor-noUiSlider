# noUiSlider (repackaged for Meteor)
_Current version: 3.1.1_

noUiSlider is a little jQuery plugin that allows you to create range sliders.
It fully supports touch, and it is way(!) less bloated than the jQueryUI library.

A full documentation for noUiSlider, including examples, is available on the [noUiSlider documentation page](http://refreshless.com/nouislider/).

This package only includes the "fox" theme.  There's another theme, "space", but I wasn't sure how to include the css for that too ... so I picked this one.
